## v1.7.0
### Displayer
- New animation for scores.

- Fixed the transparent background for displayer styles.
- Now Score Reverse changes based on the **Old Colors** setting you have.
    + Old Colors not active = Use Score Reverse if the first team is not red
    + Old Colors active = Use Score Reverse if the first team is not blue
- Team Section added.
- To add a team click on the "Open Teams Folder" button and put here the image of the team. After this you can switch to match section and return to Teams section and you will see your new team.
- Now Teams can be edited with players and team name.

- After editing the name of the team it will reload the app. (There's a bug that I'll fix, but for now this is a method to prevent the bug. Still WIP)
- The team name should be the same as the team name in the lobby name! (Ex. (Little Pug) vs (Polished) / image name = Little Pug.png / Team name in the team edit should be the same too!)

### App
- Performance improvement, now the app should use less memory!

### Known Issues
- While editing and removing players from the team, sometimes the userid will appear wrong but it'll be saved correctly!
