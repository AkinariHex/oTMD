## How to use o!TMD

The current documentation is valid for the `v1.0` of o!TMD. Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/AkinariHex/oTMD/releases/latest)!<br>
**CURRENTLY WORKS ONLY WITH LOBBIES WITH TEAMVS**

### Installation

Extract the content of the `.zip` file into a folder. Should you have the same files into the folder:

 ### Display on OBS
 
 Open ``o!TMD.exe`` from your folder, it should open a console and a page into your browser to change the settings.
 At first run it will ask you to allow the ``.exe`` for the firewall, check only for private networks and accept.

 After accepting the firewall, open your browser and you'll find the settings page, the ``.exe`` should have opened this page by himself. **You can always access to this page using this URL "http://localhost:3000"**

Change the fields:<br>

-   `api key`: put your apikey of osu! | **You can find and request the key at https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api**.
-   `match ID`: put the ID of the match you want to display. | **You can find the matchid at the end of an mp link https&#58;://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/`69509292`**
-   `best of`: select the BO of the match.
-   `warmups`: put the number of warmups. In the most of cases it's 2.
-   `score reverse`: check it only if the first team of the lobby has the colour red.<br>**For example let's see this lobby: `5WC: (Spain B) vs (South Korea A)`, Spain B should be the blue team as blue teams are always the first team for the api. If a referee make this error you can fix it checking the box of score reverse.**

Click the `save new config file` button, it'll save your settings and automatically start to display your match opening a new tab with this URL "http://localhost:3000/visualizer".

 Now you can close your browser and open OBS/SLOBS, the displayer will always work until you close the console.<br>**Do not close the console is you want to display it on OBS**
 The example I made was made with Streamlabs OBS but it's the same thing for OBS.
 
 On OBS add a new ``source > browser source``, name it and put these settings:
 * Uncheck "Local File box"
 * ``URL``: ``http://localhost:3000/visualizer`` 
 * ``Width``: ``400`` 
 * ``Height``: ``80``
 * Check "Refresh browser when scene becomes active" box
